This program generates a custom workout in the workout style that I have been doing for awhile. (My husband made it up
and we started doing it in our garage. ... hence the name GarageTrainer).

Each "round" consists of ONE exercise for each part of the body you wish to work out today. So, if
I want to work my arms and core today, I check those boxes and choose how many rounds I want to do. If I choose to do 4
rounds, the workout will look like this:

ROUND 1
1 arm exercise
1 core exercise

ROUND 2
1 arm exercise
1 core exercise

ROUND 3
1 arm exercise
1 core exercise

ROUND 4
1 arm exercise
1 core exercise

The program accesses my personal database of exercises and randomly selects all of the exercises. I can update my
database at any time: adding in new exercises, updating the suggested reps/weight if I happen to get stronger
(add more weight) or develop more endurance (more reps). It is a great workout for when I don't have a lot of time
or don't have any good ideas.

Workouts will be saved in the "files" directory when user clicks on the save button.

Get Cell Details button will show the full cell text in a popup as some names/descriptions are long. However,
it is best to save the workout and then print it out as the files are saved in a readable format.

Hope you enjoy your GarageTrainer!
